General
-------

Hatchet is a type checking and inference tool for 
Haskell 98. It currently lives at
http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~bjpop/hatchet.html

It was derived in part from "Typing Haskell in Haskell"
by Mark Jones (http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~mpj/thih/). See
the file Readme.thih for information about that project.

See the file Contributors for a list of people that 
have contributed to the Hatchet project.

Copyright and License
---------------------

Hatchet is derived from a number of different program
sources. The copyright for each is described in the
header for each such source. Please read the file

Building from Source
--------------------

Hatchet requires ghc version 5.02 or higher. A Makefile
is provided for building the project, simply run the
commands:

   make depend
   make

in the same directory as the Hatchet
source. The executable will by default be called "tc".

Usage
-----

To print the types of all top-level and let/where bound
identifiers in a module:

./tc -d types Foo.hs
